**Description: All the answers and statements are my own and are not copied from any AI or Textbook.**

Software Testing: It is a process to validate the software and check if it meets all the requirements, the aim of software testing is not just to validate but also it aims to find any error occured in software so to avoid any sort of issues/probelms while the users use it. 

Example for failed software testing: Imagine launching a mobile banking app with a bug that transfers money to the wrong account, It would be a desaster. That is why software testing is critical.  It guarantees software reliability, security and high performance, reducing the risk of failure in production. 

Errors:
- If a loginpage accepts inccorrect credentials, its a fuctional bug.
- If a page takes too long to load, it's a performance issue.
- If a site works on chrome but not on FireFox, its a compatibility issue.
- If clicking on "Buy Now" crashes the app, its a critical bug.
